Some notes:

Communication Controller desing currently supports Virtex2Pro and Virtex5 FPGA
devices. Xilinx ISE10.1 is the latest ISE version supporting Virtex2Pro
devices. Therefore, a specific modelsim.ini is being used as saved in this
directory.

IMPORTANT : modelsim.ini is prepared using compxlib 10.1i and Questasim v6.6c.
