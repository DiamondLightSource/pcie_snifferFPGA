WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'endpoint_blk_plus_v1_14_1_lane' for
   IP 'Endpoint Block Plus for PCI Express v1.14' was generated with a different
   version of the IP than is currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally
   generated using IP with the packaged timestamp '2011-02-03+22:14'; the IP in
   the current catalog has a different packaged timestamp '2012-07-21+06:17'.
   This mismatch is due to changes made to the IP in the user repositories. It
   may affect some functionality of the IP, if there are differences between
   these two versions of the IP.
